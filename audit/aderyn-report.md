# High Issues

## H-1: Return value of the function call is not checked.

Function returns a value but it is ignored.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>

-   Found in src/BaseStaking.sol [Line: 91](src/BaseStaking.sol#L91)

    ```solidity
            rewardsDistributor.collectRewards();

# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

## L-3: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

## L-4: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

## L-5: Internal functions called only once can be inlined

Instead of separating the logic into a separate function, consider inlining the logic into the calling function. This can reduce the number of function calls and improve readability.
